# Complex-Networks-Node-Removal
Models the random removal of nodes in an Erdos Renyi graph

This work was produced in reference to modelling the robustness of a botnet to removal strategies, as illustrated in the paper below. Instead of the ER graph, other graphs can be generated and their giant component size can be seen wrt different occupation probabilities. A theoretical development of the effect of random removal of nodes on the giant component size, for ER graphs, is discussed at reference 2. 

To do: Generate a graph with an out-degree, as in the Overnet graph modeled at 1.
